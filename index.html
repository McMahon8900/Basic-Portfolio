        Hello! My name is Linsay McMahon and I live in Portland, TN. I currently work for Vanderbilt Medical Center as a Pharmacy Reimbursement Specialist in the Pharmacy Billing Office on the Medicare Part B Team. I work with a great team and I love being apart of the Vanderbilt family. When I was younger I never thought I would be working in a pharmacy or hospital for that matter. 
        <br>
        I have a passion for arts and crafts. You name it I've probably done it or attempted it. Other hobbies of mine consist of reading, playing D&D, board games, and making t-shirts.
