# Basic-Portfolio
## Instructions


1. Create a new repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.


2. Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.


3. Navigate to the Basic-Portfolio folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:

   * 3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html and     portfolio.html.
    * A folder called assets.
    * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.

       * In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
        * In the images folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.
    * Make sure to git add . and git commit -m "initial site files". Then type git push origin master to push your changes to your GitHub repo.

5. Reference these screenshots for your site:

![](./assets/images/portfolio-gallery.png)
![](./assets/images/portfolio-contact.png)
    * <b>IMPORTANT</b> Your site's layout must match the designs in these screenshots. You'll find the specs for these designs below.

6. When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS and to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically, too:

   * If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
   * If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
   * So on and so forth.



7. The content for the index.html should be unique to you.

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is—that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

8. After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the style.css file you created.

   * Be sure to validate your html.
   * Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.

9. Push your changes to Github.
